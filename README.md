This directory contains the implementation of a multithreaded HTTP server in C, designed to handle multiple client requests simultaneously. The server supports GET and PUT requests, commonly used in HTTP to retrieve or upload data. A key feature of this server is its use of reader-writer locks to efficiently manage concurrent GET and PUT requests, ensuring that data is correctly accessed or modified without race conditions.
